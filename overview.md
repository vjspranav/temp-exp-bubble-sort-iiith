### Prerequisites of the Experiment


This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

   - [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!


### Overview of the Experiment

- The aim of this experiment is to understand the Bubble Sort algorithm, its time and space complexity, and how it compares against other sorting algorithms.

- The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.
