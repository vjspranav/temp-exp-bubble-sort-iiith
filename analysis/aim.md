### Learning Objectives of this Module
In this module, we will be learning about :

- **Time and Space Complexity** : We will learn about the running time of one iteration, and then extend it to N iterations to complete the sorting process.

- **Stable Sort** : We will learn about stability of sorting algorithms. Then we will see how Bubble Sort is a Stable Sort.

- **Comparison with other algorithms** : We will compare Bubble Sort with other sorting algorithms and see in which situations Bubble Sort is the optimal/not optimal approach to take.
