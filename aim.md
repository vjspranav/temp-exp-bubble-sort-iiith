### Estimated Time

1 hour

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Bubble Sort.

   - Optimise the Bubble Sort algorithm to achieve better performance.

   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Bubble Sort by counting the number of operations involved in each iteration.

   - Compare Bubble Sort with other sorting algorithms and realise Bubble Sort as a stable comparison sorting algorithm.
